# Flask App: Recommending Travel Destination


## Overview

![alt="screenshot"](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/datatostories/travel-app-screenshot.png)

This is a source code for the flask app I created. The app recommends a hotel based on the traveler's description of their ideal vacation. You can see the application in action [here](http://travel-recommender-app.herokuapp.com/).

This is based on a Natural Language Processing project I did on about 90000 TripAdvisor Hotel reviews of various vacations destinations. The github repo for the project is [here](https://github.com/youngjeong46/travel-recommender), and the blog post on the project can be found [here]("").
