# Flask App: Recommending Travel Destination


## Overview

![alt="screenshot"]()

This is a source code for the flask app I created. The app receives user info about a listing, or a potential listing, on AirBnB, and
predicts the probability of it receiving a 5-star ratings on AirBnB. The app will also suggest one amenity addition that will give the biggest probability boost. 
You can see the application in action [here]().

This is based on a classification project I did on predicting whether an AirBnB listing in Seattle will receive a 5-star ratings or not. The github repo for the project
is [here](https://github.com/youngjeong46/vacation-recommender), and the blog post on the project can be found [here]("").
